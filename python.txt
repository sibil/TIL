Tokenize a string.
string.split() - default delimiter -> space.
string.replace(',','') - removes commas

Recursion Limit:
sys.getrecursionlimit()
sys.setrecursionlimit(1500)

Mutable:
list, dictionary, bytearray, set, objects, functions

---
When you need to set a mutable variable as a default argument, always use None and then set the value in the body of the function. This prevents unexpected behavior like adding multiple columns if you call the function more than once.
my_func(x, y=None):
  if y is None:
    y = [1,2,3]

#context manager - Example 
with open(file.txt) as f:
  blah blah

#context manager creation - using function definition
# you can also create using Class by having __enter__/__exit__ methods.
@contextlib.contextmanager
def timer():
  start = time.time()
  # Send control back to the context block
  yield
  end = time.time()
  print('Elapsed: {:.2f}s'.format(end - start))


Nested context managers.
Read from a file and write to another
with open('a.txt', 'r') as read_only:
  with open('b.txt', 'w') as write_file:

Python support multiple inheritance

class Test(Base1, Base2):
   def __init__():

List 
====
for index,value in enumerate(my_list) :
  print(index, value)
       

NumPy
=======
import numpy as np
#This works for 1D array
for x in my_array :
    ...
#For 2D array, we need np.nditer iterator
for x in np.nditer(my_array) :
    ...
